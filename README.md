This Game is Called Cat v. Fish

To play the game you open up the html file and use the left, right, up, down keys, to navigate cat-girl across the rocks and into the water.
If Cat Girl comes into contact with any of the bugs, she will die and the game will reset.

The objective is to get to the water. Yes, Cat-Girl likes water.

Took out player.prototype.update as it was not being used for anything.
